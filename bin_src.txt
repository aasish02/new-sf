Steps to Run the Batch Script
1. Create the Script
Open a text editor (e.g., Notepad).
Paste the script into the editor:
batch
Copy code
@echo off

:: Set your project directories
set SRC_DIR=src
set BIN_DIR=bin

:: Make sure the bin directory exists
if not exist %BIN_DIR% mkdir %BIN_DIR%

:: Compile Java files
javac -d %BIN_DIR% %SRC_DIR%\*.java

:: Optional: Print the contents of the bin directory to see the compiled files
echo Compiled files:
dir %BIN_DIR%
Save the file with a .bat extension, e.g., compile.bat.
2. Place the Script
Place the compile.bat file in the root directory of your Java project.
Ensure your project has the following structure:
css
Copy code
ProjectRoot/
├── src/
│   ├── YourJavaFile1.java
│   ├── YourJavaFile2.java
├── compile.bat
3. Open Command Prompt
Press Win + R, type cmd, and hit Enter.
Navigate to the project directory where the batch file is located using the cd command:
cmd
Copy code
cd path\to\your\project
For example:
cmd
Copy code
cd C:\Users\YourName\JavaProjects\MyProject
4. Run the Script
Execute the batch script by typing its name:
cmd
Copy code
compile.bat
The script will:
Check if the bin directory exists; if not, it will create it.
Compile all .java files in the src directory and place the .class files in the bin directory.
Display the compiled files in the bin directory (if this part of the script is included).
Prerequisites
Java Development Kit (JDK) Installed:

Ensure javac (Java compiler) is available on your system. You can check this by running:
cmd
Copy code
javac -version
If not installed, download and install the JDK from Oracle's website or OpenJDK.
Environment Variable Configuration:

Make sure the javac command is added to your system's PATH environment variable. If it isn't, refer to this guide to set it up.
Verification
After running the script:

Check the bin directory in your project folder. It should contain .class files corresponding to the .java files in the src directory.
If there are errors in the Java code, they will appear in the Command Prompt during compilation.
